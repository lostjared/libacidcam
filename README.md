This version shares some code with Acid Cam v2 OSX, so sometimes when I update the parts that are shared show up in both projects. libacidcam uses C++/OpenCV and Autotools, and this macOS program uses Objective-C++/Cocoa/OpenCV and Xcode

When upgrading to new versions of Acid Cam Qt, acidcam-cli or any other project that uses libacidcam:

Please be sure to recompile, install and relink any applications.

When writing C++ using libacidcam  do not call another mulithreaded filter from within a mulithreaded filter inside of its loop callback

To be able to use all the filters in this library your system should have at lest 8 GB of ram.

Shared library with filters from Acid Cam

With this library you can use the same filters in your own OpenCV applications.

First install/compile OpenCV development libraries  and pkg-config.

If you want to compile with CMake use

	$ mkdir build && cd build

	$ cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON 

or

	$ cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DENABLE_TESTS=ON

or to compile examples:

	$ cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DENABLE_TESTS=ON -DENABLE_EXAMPLES=ON

	$ make -j4

to run tests to make sure everything is working (will take a while)

	$ ctest

install

	$ sudo make install

To run the test use:

    $ ./test-filter1
    

If you want to compile with Autotools this library uses pkg-config and Autoconf,Automake,Libtool.
	
	$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && sudo make install

If you are running on Linux you will need to use this command so it can find the library

	$ sudo ldconfig

Then you should be able to use pkg-config in your project and include ac.h

if you are using autotools you can use this macro in your configure.ac

be sure to recompile this library and relink programs current version is 0:0:0
